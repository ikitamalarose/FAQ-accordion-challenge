## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I focused on improving accessibility, which included learning how to conduct Screen Reader Tests and Keyboard Accessibility Tests.

- Screen Reader Tests: I learned how to use screen readers to navigate and validate that all important content is accessible and correctly interpreted. This involved checking for appropriate use of ARIA labels, landmarks, and other semantic HTML elements that ensure a seamless experience for users who rely on screen readers.

- Keyboard Accessibility Tests: I also practiced verifying that all interactive elements can be accessed and used through keyboard-only navigation. This involved ensuring focus indicators were clear, logical tab order was maintained, and all buttons, links, and form controls responded correctly to keyboard input, making the application more inclusive.

This experience has enhanced my understanding of accessibility best practices and helped me create a more user-friendly, inclusive application.
